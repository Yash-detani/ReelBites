ReelBites is a modern food discovery platform where users explore short food reels, like and interact with dishes, and food partners upload their own reels to attract customers.

The system is built with a three-dashboard architecture, ensuring a clear separation of roles:

👤 User Dashboard — Watch reels, like food items, view personalized feed

🍴 Food Partner Dashboard — Upload food reels & manage posted items

🍽️ Food Dashboard — (Admin/Partner side) Manage food details & content

The platform delivers a fast, smooth, and interactive UI experience similar to Instagram Reels but tailored for food ordering.
